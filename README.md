WintAR is a TF.js based gesture recognition interface to spice up Video Conferencing calls during your Winter Holidays ‚òÉÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è. Whoofus is easy to run & requires no custom application/software installation. Just click on [View Demo](https://hohoholidays.us) & directly use it on the browser! 

Whoofus runs on both on PC & mobile directly on the browser (on Canvas), although PC is always recommended for much better experience! ‚ú®

- Story
```
Hello folks, wassup

How's your winter vacation going? Lemme guess, you're absolutely bored right? Well I can understand, what else can we do in this claustrophobic pandemic scenario? Well there's something that I can do. Presenting WintAR!

Lemme show how it works. So hope y'all had a great Christmas, & now since santa's went back to his home, the christmas trees are feeling lonely :(

But the snowman's still here, smiling & enjoying winter like there's no tomorrow. Let's assume he's busy coding, well that's too much. Who codes in this time :P

He is probably enjoying the snow outside. Haha

Oopsie, i forgot to check what santa sent me this year, lemme have a look? Seems something interesting tbh. Oh this is WintAR.

With that, happy holidays guys, see y'all in next year! :)
